SECTION 11 — DATA DISGORGEMENT, MONETARY DAMAGES,
             AND AUDIT RIGHTS
==================================================

BlackRoad OS, Inc. asserts absolute rights to trace, audit, quantify,
and recover damages from any unauthorized use of its data, code,
documentation, or intellectual property.

11.1 RIGHT TO DATA RETURN AND DISGORGEMENT.

     (a) Any entity that has ingested, cached, stored, indexed,
         processed, trained on, fine-tuned with, evaluated against,
         or otherwise used BlackRoad OS, Inc.'s Software, code,
         documentation, or data ("Unauthorized Data") is REQUIRED to:

         (i)   Immediately cease all use of Unauthorized Data;
         (ii)  Identify and disclose all instances where Unauthorized
               Data exists within their systems, models, training
               sets, evaluation sets, caches, indexes, embeddings,
               vector databases, and derived outputs;
         (iii) Delete all Unauthorized Data and all derivatives
               thereof from all systems, including but not limited
               to model weights that incorporated Unauthorized Data
               during training;
         (iv)  Provide a certified, itemized accounting of all
               Unauthorized Data in their possession, signed under
               penalty of perjury by a corporate officer;
         (v)   Return to BlackRoad OS, Inc. complete copies of all
               Unauthorized Data, including metadata showing when
               and how it was acquired.

     (b) The obligation to disgorge data is RETROACTIVE and applies
         regardless of when the data was acquired, whether before or
         after the effective date of this Agreement. The act of having
         public repositories does not constitute consent to data
         collection for any purpose other than human viewing through
         a web browser.

11.2 MONETARY DAMAGES FRAMEWORK.

     Any entity found to have used BlackRoad OS, Inc.'s intellectual
     property without authorization shall be liable for the GREATER
     of the following:

     (a) ACTUAL DAMAGES: All direct and consequential damages
         suffered by BlackRoad OS, Inc., including lost licensing
         revenue, diminished trade secret value, and competitive harm.

     (b) DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS: One hundred percent (100%) of all
         revenue, profits, and financial benefit derived by the
         infringer from any product, service, model, or system that
         was developed, trained, improved, evaluated, or marketed
         using BlackRoad OS, Inc.'s intellectual property.

     (c) STATUTORY DAMAGES: Up to $150,000 per work infringed under
         17 U.S.C. Section 504(c)(2) for willful infringement.

     (d) PROPORTIONAL ROYALTY DAMAGES: Calculated as follows:

         (i)   TRAINING DATA ROYALTY: If BlackRoad data constituted
               any portion of a training dataset, BlackRoad OS, Inc.
               is entitled to a pro-rata share of ALL revenue
               generated by the resulting model, calculated as:

               Royalty = (BlackRoad Data Volume / Total Training Data)
                         x (Total Model Revenue) x (Multiplier of 3x)

               The 3x multiplier reflects the enhanced value of
               curated, proprietary code and documentation versus
               generic training data.

         (ii)  MINIMUM ROYALTY FLOOR: Regardless of the proportional
               calculation, the minimum royalty for any unauthorized
               use of BlackRoad data in model training shall be no
               less than ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000) per model
               per year in which the model was offered commercially.

         (iii) INFERENCE ROYALTY: If any model trained on BlackRoad
               data generates output in response to user queries,
               BlackRoad OS, Inc. is entitled to $0.01 per inference
               call made to that model, or 5% of per-query revenue,
               whichever is greater.

         (iv)  EMBEDDING ROYALTY: If BlackRoad code, documentation,
               or data has been converted to embeddings or vector
               representations for use in retrieval-augmented
               generation (RAG), search indexes, or code suggestion
               systems, BlackRoad OS, Inc. is entitled to $0.001
               per retrieval query against those embeddings plus
               a lump-sum royalty of $500,000 per database containing
               BlackRoad embeddings.

     (e) TREBLE DAMAGES: In cases of willful, knowing, or reckless
         infringement, all damages under this Section shall be
         TREBLED (multiplied by three) pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section
         1117(b) and applicable trade secret statutes.

     (f) COMPOUNDING INTEREST: All damages accrue interest at the
         rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum from the date of
         first unauthorized use until paid in full.

     (g) AUDIT AND INVESTIGATION COSTS: The infringer shall pay all
         costs incurred by BlackRoad OS, Inc. in detecting,
         investigating, and proving the infringement, including
         forensic analysis, expert witness fees, and e-discovery
         costs.

11.3 MANDATORY AUDIT AND TRANSPARENCY RIGHTS.

     (a) RIGHT TO AUDIT. BlackRoad OS, Inc. has the absolute right
         to audit any entity suspected of using its intellectual
         property. Upon written demand, the audited entity shall:

         (i)   Provide complete access to training data manifests,
               data provenance records, and dataset composition logs;
         (ii)  Disclose all sources of code used in training,
               including GitHub repositories scraped or crawled;
         (iii) Provide model cards, datasheets, and documentation
               describing training data sources;
         (iv)  Allow independent third-party forensic analysis of
               model weights, embedding spaces, and training
               pipelines to detect BlackRoad data signatures;
         (v)   Respond to all audit requests within thirty (30)
               calendar days.

     (b) FAILURE TO COMPLY with an audit request shall create a
         REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION that the entity used BlackRoad
         data in its training, and damages shall be calculated at
         the maximum rate under Section 11.2.

     (c) ONGOING MONITORING RIGHTS. BlackRoad OS, Inc. shall have
         the ongoing right to:

         (i)   Submit test prompts to any AI system to detect
               memorized or regurgitated BlackRoad code, documentation,
               or proprietary terminology;
         (ii)  Analyze AI-generated outputs for fingerprints of
               BlackRoad intellectual property (see Section 11.4);
         (iii) Engage third-party auditors to inspect training data
               and model behavior;
         (iv)  Subpoena training data records, crawler logs, and
               GitHub API access logs in the event of litigation.

11.4 CODE FINGERPRINTING AND DIGITAL WATERMARKING.

     (a) BlackRoad OS, Inc. embeds proprietary digital fingerprints,
         watermarks, canary tokens, stylometric markers, and unique
         identifiers ("Fingerprints") throughout its Software,
         including but not limited to:

         (i)   Unique variable naming conventions and code patterns
               that serve as stylometric signatures;
         (ii)  Canary strings embedded in documentation, comments,
               and configuration files;
         (iii) Steganographic markers in media assets, images, and
               binary files;
         (iv)  Unique mathematical formulations (Amundson Equations)
               that are traceable if reproduced;
         (v)   Agent personality definitions and response patterns
               that constitute recognizable creative expression;
         (vi)  Hash-chain journal entries (PS-SHA-infinity) that
               create verifiable provenance chains;
         (vii) Proprietary terminology (e.g., "Intelligence Routing,"
               "Tokenless Gateway," "Directory Waterfall,"
               "Trinary Logic," "Depth Scoring," "Respectful
               Economics") that constitutes protectable trade dress.

     (b) DETECTION METHODOLOGY. The presence of any Fingerprint in
         an AI model's outputs, training data, or embedding space
         constitutes PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE of unauthorized use of
         BlackRoad intellectual property.

     (c) TAMPERING PROHIBITION. Any attempt to remove, alter,
         obscure, or circumvent Fingerprints constitutes:
         (i)   Circumvention of copyright management information
               under 17 U.S.C. Section 1202;
         (ii)  Circumvention of technological protection measures
               under 17 U.S.C. Section 1201 (DMCA Anti-Circumvention);
         (iii) Additional grounds for treble damages.

     (d) AUTOMATED DETECTION SYSTEMS. BlackRoad OS, Inc. operates
         automated monitoring systems that:
         (i)   Query major AI APIs (including but not limited to
               ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Copilot, and
               CodeWhisperer) for memorized BlackRoad content;
         (ii)  Monitor code suggestion platforms for BlackRoad
               code patterns;
         (iii) Scan model hubs (including Hugging Face, GitHub
               Models, and Replicate) for unauthorized derivatives;
         (iv)  Analyze published model documentation and papers for
               references to BlackRoad data;
         (v)   Monitor domain registrations and app stores for
               trademark infringement.

     (e) EVIDENCE PRESERVATION. All detection results are
         automatically logged, timestamped, and preserved in
         tamper-proof hash-chain journals (PS-SHA-infinity) for
         use as evidence in legal proceedings.

11.5 PLATFORM-SPECIFIC DATA RIGHTS.

     (a) GITHUB / MICROSOFT. BlackRoad OS, Inc. expressly opts out
         of all GitHub terms permitting the use of repository
         contents for AI training, code suggestions, or model
         development, including but not limited to GitHub Copilot
         and any successor products. This opt-out is effectuated
         under GitHub's Terms of Service and Privacy Statement,
         and is further reinforced by this Agreement.

     (b) HUGGING FACE. No BlackRoad data, code, models, or assets
         may be hosted on, distributed through, or indexed by
         Hugging Face without express written authorization.

ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
SOFTWARE, OR ANY BLACKROAD OS, INC. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SHALL BE
RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH THE BLACKROAD DISPUTE RESOLUTION
FRAMEWORK ("BDRF") AS SET FORTH BELOW, PRIOR TO ANY COURT ACTION.

12.1 MANDATORY PRE-DISPUTE NOTICE.

     (a) Before initiating any claim, the disputing party ("Claimant")
         must deliver a written Dispute Notice to BlackRoad OS, Inc.
         at alexa@blackroad.io with the subject line:
         "BDRF DISPUTE NOTICE — [Claimant Name]".

     (b) The Dispute Notice must include: (i) identity and contact
         information of the Claimant; (ii) a detailed description of
         the alleged dispute; (iii) the specific provisions of this
         Agreement at issue; (iv) the relief sought; and (v) all

     (c) BlackRoad OS, Inc. shall have sixty (60) calendar days from
         receipt of a complete Dispute Notice to review, investigate,
         and respond ("Review Period"). During the Review Period, the
         Claimant may not initiate any legal proceeding, arbitration,
         or other action.

     (d) FAILURE TO COMPLY with this Section 12.1 renders any
         subsequently filed claim VOID and subject to immediate
         dismissal. The Claimant shall bear all costs associated
         with any improperly filed action, including BlackRoad's
         attorney's fees.

12.2 BLACKROAD TECHNICAL REVIEW PANEL.

     (a) If the dispute involves technical matters (including but not
         limited to: code ownership, contribution attribution, agent
         behavior, system architecture, API usage, deployment
         configurations, or intellectual property boundaries), the
         dispute shall first be submitted to the BlackRoad Technical
         Review Panel ("BTRP").

     (b) The BTRP shall consist of three (3) members:
         - One (1) appointed by BlackRoad OS, Inc. (who shall serve
           as Chair);
         - One (1) appointed by the Claimant; and
         - One (1) mutually agreed upon by both parties. If the parties
           cannot agree on the third member within fifteen (15) days,
           BlackRoad OS, Inc. shall appoint the third member from a
           pool of qualified technology professionals.

     (c) The Chair of the BTRP shall have the authority to:
         - Set procedural rules and timelines;
         - Determine the scope of technical review;
         - Request additional documentation from either party;
         - Issue preliminary technical findings.

     (d) The BTRP shall issue a Technical Determination within thirty
         (30) days of its formation. The Technical Determination shall
         include: (i) findings of fact regarding the technical dispute;
         (ii) analysis of code provenance, commit history, and
         contribution records; (iii) determination of IP ownership;
         and (iv) recommended resolution.

     (e) The Technical Determination shall be PRESUMPTIVELY VALID
         in any subsequent arbitration or court proceeding. The burden
         of overcoming the Technical Determination shall rest on the
         party challenging it, who must demonstrate clear and
         convincing error.

12.3 MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION.

     (a) If the dispute is not resolved through the BTRP process or
         does not involve technical matters, it shall be resolved by
         BINDING ARBITRATION administered under the rules of the
         American Arbitration Association ("AAA") Commercial
         Arbitration Rules then in effect.

     (b) ARBITRATION TERMS:
         - Venue: Hennepin County, Minnesota, or alternatively
           New Castle County, Delaware, at the sole election of
           BlackRoad OS, Inc.
         - Language: English
         - Arbitrator: One (1) arbitrator selected from the AAA's
           roster of technology and intellectual property arbitrators.
           BlackRoad OS, Inc. shall have the right to strike up to
           five (5) proposed arbitrators without cause.
         - Governing Law: Delaware law (for corporate and IP matters)
           and federal law (for copyright, trademark, and trade secret
           matters).

     (c) ARBITRATION PROCEDURES FAVORING IP PROTECTION:
         - The arbitrator shall apply a PRESUMPTION that all code,
           documentation, and materials within BlackRoad OS, Inc.
           repositories are the exclusive property of BlackRoad OS,
           Inc. unless the Claimant provides clear and convincing
           evidence to the contrary.
         - The arbitrator shall give SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT to: git commit
           history, GitHub audit logs, repository creation dates,
           BlackRoad's CLAUDE.md files, memory system journals
           (PS-SHA-infinity hash chains), and BlackRoad's internal
           documentation.
         - The arbitrator shall recognize that public visibility of
           repositories does NOT constitute open-source licensing or
           abandonment of proprietary rights.
         - The arbitrator shall apply the doctrine of INEVITABLE
           DISCLOSURE to trade secret claims, recognizing that
           exposure to BlackRoad's proprietary architecture, agent
           systems, and methodologies creates an inevitable risk of
           disclosure.

     (d) COST ALLOCATION:
         - Each party shall bear its own costs during arbitration.
         - The LOSING PARTY shall pay: (i) all arbitration fees and
           administrative costs; (ii) the prevailing party's
           reasonable attorney's fees; (iii) all expert witness fees;
           (iv) all costs of the BTRP review if applicable; and
           (v) a procedural surcharge of twenty-five percent (25%)
           of the total award to compensate BlackRoad OS, Inc. for
           the disruption caused by the dispute.
         - If the Claimant's recovery is less than the amount of
           BlackRoad's last written settlement offer, the Claimant
           shall be deemed the losing party for purposes of cost
           allocation.

     (e) EXPEDITED PROCEEDINGS FOR IP INFRINGEMENT:
         - Claims involving copyright infringement, trademark
           infringement, or trade secret misappropriation shall
           proceed on an EXPEDITED basis with discovery limited to
           sixty (60) days.
         - BlackRoad OS, Inc. may seek EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
           from the arbitrator within forty-eight (48) hours of
           filing, without the necessity of posting bond.
         - The arbitrator shall presume irreparable harm in cases
           of unauthorized copying, distribution, or use of
           BlackRoad's Software.

12.4 CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE WAIVER.

     (a) ALL DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.
         You waive the right to participate in any class action,
         collective action, representative action, or consolidated
         arbitration against BlackRoad OS, Inc.

     (b) No arbitrator or court shall have authority to preside over
         any form of class, collective, or representative proceeding,
         or to consolidate claims of multiple parties.

     (c) If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable,
         then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be
         null and void, and disputes shall proceed exclusively in
         the courts specified in Section 8.2.

12.5 CONFIDENTIALITY OF PROCEEDINGS.

     (a) All aspects of the dispute resolution process, including
         the existence of the dispute, all submissions, evidence,
         testimony, the BTRP Technical Determination, the arbitral
         award, and any settlement terms, shall be STRICTLY
         CONFIDENTIAL.

     (b) The Claimant may not disclose any aspect of the proceedings
         to any third party, media outlet, social media platform,
         or public forum without the express written consent of
         BlackRoad OS, Inc. Violation of this confidentiality
         provision shall result in liquidated damages of FIFTY
         THOUSAND DOLLARS ($50,000) per disclosure, in addition to
         any other remedies available.

     (c) BlackRoad OS, Inc. reserves the right to disclose the
         outcome of proceedings to the extent necessary to enforce
         the award or protect its intellectual property rights.

12.6 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

     Any claim arising under this Agreement must be brought within
     ONE (1) YEAR of the date the Claimant knew or should have known
     of the facts giving rise to the claim. Claims not brought within
     this period are PERMANENTLY BARRED, regardless of any longer
     statute of limitations that might otherwise apply under
     applicable law.

12.7 PRESERVATION OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, BlackRoad OS, Inc. retains the
     right to seek injunctive relief, temporary restraining orders,
     or other equitable relief in ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION
     at any time, without first submitting to the BDRF process.
     This right is absolute and not subject to the pre-dispute notice
     requirement. The Claimant does NOT have a reciprocal right to
     bypass the BDRF process.

12.8 SURVIVAL OF FRAMEWORK.

     This dispute resolution framework survives termination of this
     Agreement, abandonment of the Software, dissolution of BlackRoad
     OS, Inc. (in which case rights transfer to Alexa Louise Amundson
     individually), and any change in applicable law.
